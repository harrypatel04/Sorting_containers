# Implementations
Basic data structure implementations in C++ and Python. To work through and make sure I understand the data structures themselves, and not just their implementation in a single language.

Contents:
* `LinkedList.py`: Implementation of a singly linked list in Python
* `CLinkedList.py`: Implementation of a circularly linked list in Python
* `DLinkedList.py`: Implementation of a doubly linked list in Python
* `Stack.py`: Implementation of a stack in Python
* `Queue.py`: Implementation of a queue in Python
* `Deque.py`: Implementation of a double ended queue in Python
* `Vector.py`: Basic vector class in Python
* `Graph.py`: Graph class in Python.
* `Node.py`: Node class used by `Graph.py` and possibly `LinkedList.py`
* `LinkedList.h`: Interface for the three implementations of a linked list.
* `LinkedList.cpp`: Implementation of a singly linked list in C++
* `CLinkedList.cpp`: Implementation of a circularly linked list in C++
* `DLinkedList.cpp`: Implementation of a double linked list in C++
* `Stack.h`: Interface for stack class
* `Queue.h`: Interface for queue class
* `Deque.h`: Interface for double ended queue class
* `Stack.cpp`: Implementation of a stack in C++
* `Queue.cpp`: Implementation of a queue in C++
* `Deque.cpp`: Implementation of a double ended queue in C++

TODO:
* Template classes
* `.at()` and `[]` for linked lists (access, insert, and remove from a given position)
* Overloaded operators
  - `[]`
  - `+`
  - `<<`
  - `-`
  - `==`?
